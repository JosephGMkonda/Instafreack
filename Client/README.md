# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

This is social media application.(INSTAFREACK)
The social media system developed in ReactJS, NodeJS, and MongoDB is a powerful platform that provides a user-friendly and dynamic experience for its users. 
The system is designed to enable users to create profiles, share posts, connect with friends, and build a social network. 
It has been developed using the latest technologies, providing a fast and reliable platform for users to connect and interact.

ReactJS is used to develop the frontend of the social media system. 
It is a powerful JavaScript library that allows developers to build reusable user interfaces using modular components. 
The ReactJS framework ensures that the user interface is fast and responsive, providing a seamless user experience. 
Additionally, ReactJS provides a variety of tools and libraries that make it easy to build complex UI components, 
which are an essential part of any social media system.

NodeJS is used to develop the backend of the social media system. 
It is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build server-side applications.


Finally, MongoDB is used as the database for the social media system. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable solution for
managing large volumes of data. It is designed to handle unstructured data and provides high availability and automatic scaling.


Overall, the social media system developed in ReactJS, NodeJS, and MongoDB provides a robust and scalable platform that enables users to connect 
and interact in a dynamic and engaging way. It leverages the latest technologies to provide a fast a
nd responsive user experience, making it an ideal choice for building social media systems.
